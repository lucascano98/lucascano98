# 👋 Hi, I’m Lucas

I'm a U.S. Marine transitioning into software development, focused on writing clean, practical code and building tools that solve real problems. Right now, I'm working in C# and Python while building out my skills through hands-on projects.

## 🛠 Current Project

### Marine Security Guard Scheduler
A C# console application that generates monthly duty schedules for Marine Security Guard detachments. It handles:
- Multiple posts with custom hours
- Fair shift distribution and coverage
- Guard Workload Factor (GWLF) compliance
- Worker availability and mid-month shift changes
- Custom rules for shift streaks and off-day logic

This project reflects real-world scheduling challenges and is built to solve an actual need.

## 💻 Tools & Languages

- C# (.NET console apps)
- Python (automation and scripting)
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code

- ## 🔍 What I'm Looking For

- Feedback on my code and approach
- Mentorship from experienced developers
- Open-source projects that align with practical problem-solving
- Connections with other learners and builders
